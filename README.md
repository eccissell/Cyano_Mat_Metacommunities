# Cyanobacterial_Mat_Metacommunities
Code and data files for Cissell and McCoy In Review: Predation, community asynchrony, and metacommunity stability in cyanobacterial mats (Preprint Available Here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511315v1) and Cissell and McCoy In Review: Viral association with cyanoabcterial mat community mortality. 

Data are currently provided as private for peer review only. Please email Ethan (ecissell@unc.edu) for permissions to use data and/or code prior to acceptance of the manuscript for publication.

Code files include:
- A combined R script used in the statistical analysis of all data and for generating plots
- The code for the bioinformatic analysis of the viral data
- The code for the metacommunity cellular automaton model (in C)


Data files include:
- Benthic cover data of cyanobacterial mat metacommunities across time (.csv)
- Survival data from the field coring experiment (.csv)
- Fish foraging data (.csv)
- Model output dataframe (.csv)
- The vDeath database - a curated database of viral sequences recovered from a dying cyanobacterial mat (.fasta and .faa).
